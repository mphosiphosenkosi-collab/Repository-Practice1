## Reflection Questions:

**What was the most challenging part?**

Balancing technical depth with accessibility for mixed audience.

**What surprised you during preparation?**

How much the documentation work improved my own understanding of the system.

**What would you do differently with more time?**

Create interactive diagrams and include video demonstrations for users, depending on the stage of development i would use tools like figma and/or canva to create prototype visuals of the products functionalities.

**Biggest takeaway:**

Clear communication about technical systems requires understanding both the technology AND the audience's perspective.
